# Algorithms_Learning
## Introduction
A template lib of data structures and algorithms of book Introduction to Algorithms, mainly based on C++

## Status
This lib will be aperiodically updated. And I'll maintain this lib since **six months after the time when it will be finished**.

From now on, I have implemented the basic DS and algorithms like list, queue, tree or searching, select algorithms. But with profound learning of *Introduction to Algorithms*, it became more and more difficult for me to design a sufficiently generic code for devise situations. BFS, for instance, is usually used for different issues, and I can't conceive a template to satisfy those whole problem. Thus my many implements of graph and successive implements, conspicuously, will be demonstrative. Or I'll put them into 'Practice' directory.

It's welcome to learn or test my code. And don't hesitate to subject issue if you have any question.
