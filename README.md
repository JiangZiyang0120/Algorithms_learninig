# Algorithms_Learning
## Introduction
A template lib of data structures and algorithms of book Introduction to Algorithms, mainly based on C++

## Status
This lib will be aperiodically updated. And I'll maintain this lib since **six months after the time when it will be finished**.
I have already finished four sorting algorithms in the first 6 chapters. And I'm keeping completing other algorithms.

## Usage
The whole lib will be written by template, and it is easily be included in your project **by including the header file "./algorithms.h"**
